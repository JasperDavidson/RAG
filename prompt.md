I will define a couple modules as black boxes and tell you their function. 
Based on their funciton I want you to generate a structural netlist based on a prompt
I give you that will be formatted into steps. 

In the file test.v I have defined the black box modules. 
The first is diffmix. Anytime I say to mix, combine, or place with something use
this module. 

The next is a membrane filter. Anytime I say to filter or pass thurough a filter,
use this module. 

The next is a serpentine. Anytime I say dilute, use this module.

The final module is a incubation_chamber. Anytime I say to incubate or store 
and heat use this module.

According to the prompt and the verilog modules I provide, I need you to design a microfluidic circuit using connecting those verilog modules together to perform the function I require. Only use the verilog modules I provide you in the prompt. Do not use any modules not passed to you through structural verilog.

Do not use any modules not passed to you through structural verilog. Do not use any modules not passed to you through structural verilog.
